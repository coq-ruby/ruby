# Coq and Ruby
This is an anonymous repository for the iFM25 submission "A Coq Formalization of the Ruby Language for Relational Hardware Description".

Basic definitions and proofs are included for some initial impressions. Full case studies and additional examples will be available for the artifact evaluation if the submission is accepted.

Coq source code dependency is illustrated in the following tree.
```
axioms.v
└── rel.v
    └── basic.v
        ├── loop.v
        └── wire.v
            └── rec.v
                └── horners.v
